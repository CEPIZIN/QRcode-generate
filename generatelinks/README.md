## QR Code Generator React App

This is a simple React project for generating QR codes from URLs, developed with the purpose of assisting people in quickly generating QR codes. The application allows users to enter a URL in the input field, and upon submitting the form, the user's input is logged to the console.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a main functional component named `App`. State is managed using the `useState` hook to track the user's input value. The `handleSubmit` function is called when the form is submitted, preventing the default form behavior and logging the user's input to the console.
